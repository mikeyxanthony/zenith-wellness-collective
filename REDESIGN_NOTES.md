## 🎨 Visual Identity

### **Color Palette**

```css
Primary Colors:
- Cream: #F7F5F3 (background)
- Charcoal: #2C2C2C (primary text)
- Black: #1A1A1A (headings)
- White: #FFFFFF (sections)

Accent Colors:
- Warm Gray: #5C5855 (secondary text)
- Light Gray: #E8E6E3 (borders)
- Soft Brown: #9B8B7E (accents)
- Muted Brown: #B4A196 (highlights)
```

**Rationale**: Muted, sophisticated palette that feels both professional and warm. The cream and charcoal combination creates a calm, premium aesthetic perfect for wellness services.

### **Typography**

```css
Display Font: 'DM Serif Display' (italic, elegant)
Body Font: 'Inter' (clean, modern, highly readable)

Hierarchy:
- Hero Title: 60px (responsive)
- Section Titles: 36px
- Subsection Titles: 20px
- Body Text: 16px
- Small Text: 14px
- Micro Text: 12px
```

**Approach**: High contrast between serif display font (emotional, personal) and sans-serif body (professional, clear). Creates sophisticated visual rhythm.

## 📐 Layout Principles

### **Spacing System**

```css
Micro spacing: 0.5rem (8px)
Small: 1rem (16px)
Medium: 2rem (32px)
Large: 3rem (48px)
XL: 4rem (64px)
2XL: 6rem (96px)
3XL: 8rem (128px)
4XL: 12rem (192px)
```

**Key Principle**: Generous whitespace creates breathing room and premium feel. Sections have 128px padding for maximum airiness.

### **Grid Structure**

- **Container Max Width**: 1200px
- **Narrow Container**: 800px (for reading-focused sections)
- **Grid Gaps**: 48-96px for visual separation
